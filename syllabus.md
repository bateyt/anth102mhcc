## General Course Information

- **Course ID:**  ANTH102, Section W1
- **Course Title:** Introduction to Archaeology and World Prehistory
- **Course Location:** Online (Blackboard)
- **Credits:** 3
- **Pre-requisites:** RD90 and WR90


## Instuctor Contact Information

- **Name:** Trey Batey
- **MHCC email:** <trey.batey@mhcc.edu>
- **MHCC voicemail:** 503-491-6245 (ext. 3441)
- **MHCC Office Hours:** None (virtual office only)

The best way to get in touch with me is through MHCC email. You can send me messages through Blackboard's "Mailbox" system, as well, but in my experience, this tool is clunky. I typically check email at least once a day and check my messages each time I log in to the course. Unless circumstances prevent me from doing so, I will respond to messages within 48 hours, typically within 24.


## Required Materials
 
- **Textbook:**  Chazan, M. 2014. _World history and archaeology: pathways through time, 3rd edition_. New Jersey: Prentice Hall (Pearson Education, Inc.).
 
I strongly encourage you to obtain a copy of the textbook, which is available at the [MHCC Bookstore](http://www.bookstore.mhcc.cc.or.us/buy_main.asp?). A cost-effective alternative is to access the textbook in digital format. The MHCC Bookstore [provides information](http://www.bookstore.mhcc.cc.or.us/about_jumpbooks.asp?)---FAQ's, recommended computer requirements, etc.---on accessing textbooks online or downloading them for use offline. If this option appeals to you, visit [CourseSmart](http://www.coursesmart.com/IR/3058874/9780205953400?__hdv=6.8). 

The textbook provides a general structure for course content, serves as a supplement, with more-detailed information, to presentation slideshows, and a reference throughout the course. Additional materials are available through the publisher, but these are not required.


## Attendance/Participation Requirements
 
* You should log into the course on the __first day__ of classes.
* Before you can access any lessons, you must do the following:
    + read through the syllabus and schedule and mark them as "Reviewed,"
    + take a short survey,
    + participate discussion activity for introductions,
    + take a short quiz to familiarize yourself with Blackboard's testing system.
  
After you have completed those steps, you may will have access to the course content, as it becomes available. __I expect students to login and actively participate in throughout the course.__ To see how a typical weekly lesson may look, see the sample weekly schedule below.

### Sample Weekly Schedule
Typically, new content will be released at midnight on Tuesdays. Thus, you will have a full week to complete _all_ assignments for a particular lesson, with assignments due by the end of the day (i.e., 11:59 PM) on Mondays. __Please don't fall into the trap of waiting until Monday night to begin working on assignments.__ Some assignments, specifically discussion activities, require you to submit the minimum number of posts---generally two---on separate days. So, in these instances, waiting until Monday to submit all your posts would result in a loss of points. The table below is an example of the work-flow for a typical week.

Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. & Sun. | Mon.
----- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----
Begin looking at new lesson content | Continue looking at content; submit first discussion post | Continue looking at content; __deadline to submit initial thread post to discussion forum__ | Work on additional activities; maybe submit second discussion (response) post | Work on additional activities; __deadline to submit at least one of two required response posts to discussion forum__; take quiz | __Deadline to take quiz__; __deadline to submit secondary response posts to discussion forum__


## Communication Guidelines
 
I will make all-class communications through Blackboard's Announcements tool, accessible in the left-side menu and, also, from the Dashboard.

For students:

- If you have a _general_ question about the class (e.g., content, technology issues...), post a message in the SOS board. If you are unsure about something or having some technical issue, there's a chance are others are, too.  The SOS discussion board allows everyone to see questions and answers.

- If you have a question about your assignment (e.g., grade, feedback…), please contact me directly via email or Blackboard's message system.

- Even though we live in a text-message (or Tweet-) world, when it comes to spelling/grammar, please keep all discussion posts and other messages (semi-)formal. Limit the use of abbreviations. In other words, write as if we were speaking in a face-to-face setting.

- Be to the point, and please keep all discussion posts relevant to the forum subject. Most of all, please keep __ALL__ posts polite and respectful. Check these [general guidelines for etiquette](http://online.uwc.edu/technology/etiquette) in an online learning environment. In advance, thank you.

## Student Responsibilities
 
Since this is an introductory course, the material has more breadth than depth. To better understand more abstract concepts, you have to understand at least the basic jargon (terminology) used in the field of anthropology and sub-field of archaeology. Background readings, slideshows, and online resources are meant to expose you to terms and concepts with which you need to become familiar. For example, let's say you have an assignment to address the following questions in a Discussion forum:
 
> What are some examples of natural and cultural transformation processes that affect archaeological sites? How could any one or more of these bias archaeological interpretations?
 
Before you can comment on this question, you need to know what a _transformation process_ is, as it relates to archaeology. Thus, your performance in the Discussions assumes that you keep current with the readings and other course material.
 
Participation is essential in an online learning environment. Regular participation will help determine your learning outcomes and your grade. In addition to reading and activities, each lesson includes a moderated discussion in which you are (usually) required to post at least twice—first in response to an opening statement/question, second in response to a classmate's initial post.
 
Since you pay for it, take advantage of the MHCC's resources. Many great resources to help students succeed are available at the [MHCC Learning Success Center](http://www.mhcc.edu/lsc/), including resources for the following:

- [Computer help](http://www.mhcc.edu/StudentServices.aspx?id=404)

- [Study skills/time management](http://www.mhcc.edu/StudentServices.aspx?id=403)

- [English Language Learners (ELL)](http://www.mhcc.edu/StudentServices.aspx?id=400)
 
Finding information is essential for research. The [MHCC Library](http://www.mhcc.edu/Library.aspx) is a great source of many useful tools, including tutorials on how to find books and articles. For example, you may need to search a social science database to find an article about prehistoric human migration to the Western Hemisphere. Tutorials also provide in information on how to avoid plagiarism. For more information, see [MHCC's Student Code of Conduct](http://www.mhcc.edu/coc/).


## Grades
 
Letter grades are based on a standard, 10-point scale:  100-90% = A, 89-80% = B, 79-70% = C, 69-60% = D, and below 60% = F). All graded activities (lesson activities, quizzes, discussions, etc.) are graded with a point-to-percent system (i.e., percent grade = points earned/points possible). Your final grade, though, is determined by a __weighted average__ (see grading table below) of the different types of activities. For example, your average for discussion assignments counts for 30% of the final grade, so it is essential that you participate in all discussion activities.

### Grading Table

Assignment Type | Percent of Final Grade
--------------- | ----------------------
Discussions (7--8) | 30%
Quizzes (9--10) | 25%
Miscellaneous lesson activity (2--3) | 20%
Midterm exam | 12.5%
Final exam | 12.5%
__Total__ | __100%__


## Late Work Policy

Points will be deducted for Discussion or miscellaneous lesson assignments completed after the due date, though these __will NOT be accepted if turned in more than three days late__. A point-equivalent of a letter grade will be deducted from quizzes each day late. __Exams will NOT be accepted late.__
