### What to expect
Activities for this lesson include a discussion and quiz. In addition to going over the lecture slideshow, you may be interested (and, it would be helpful) in checking out some other resources that offer more details on early plant and animal domestication and developments in social complexity around the world.

-------

Some extra notes on plant/animal domestication in the New World:

- Did the America's earliest domesticated plant---the bottle gourd---have <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/102/51/18315.full" target="_blank">an Asian origin</a>?

### Give the "New" World Some Love
In the past, although not so much these days, North American archaeology has largely played second-fiddle to archaeology in other parts of the world, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" target="_blank">Old World</a>. There are a number of reasons for this trajectory of archaeological research. For one, until relatively recently, the Western Hemisphere was largely unknown to Europeans. And, recall that early archaeologists (well, _antiquarians_) were, generally, European. Another factor is that, at least in eastern North America, prehistoric and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protohistory" target="_blank">protohistoric</a> societies did not have access to the same types of raw building materials used in other regions, like stone in Mesoamerica or adobe in the American Southwest. Thus, prior to U.S. westward expansion, explorers and early archaeologists had little permanent architecture to observe.

That all changed, as people began recording the existence of large, earthen mounds along the Mississippi River and river valleys of its larger tributaries (e.g., Ohio River, Illinois River, etc.). These mounds ranged in size and shape; some were conical, platform, or even effigy mounds, like the Great Serpent Mound (pictured above) and a bird effigy mound, located within Effigy Mounds National Monument, Iowa.

Mound centers like Cahokia (Illinois), Moundville (Alabama), and others provided support for the idea that prehistoric North American was home to socially complex societies. In the last hundred years, more and more research has provided evidence that social complexity developed in a myriad of ways, dependent upon local conditions (i.e., environment, ecology, cultural history...).  Another great example is the Kuk Swamp area, where archaeologists uncovered some of the earliest evidence of agriculture in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. This complexity is exactly what this lesson is about.
