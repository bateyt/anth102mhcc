In this discussion activity, students will ponder what the archaeological evidence suggests about variation in plant/animal domestication and developments in social complexity around the world.

### Instructions
After going through the lesson content, including module pages, the lecture slideshow, and other electronic resources, complete the following: 

1. Choose a specific region/site discussed in this lesson's content (module, slides, web links). Address these two questions:

- What information did you find most interesting about...
    + the particular plants/animals domesticated there?
    + evidence for developments in social complexity there?
    
2. Throughout the week, return to the discussion forum and submit a response to __at least two classmates' original threads__. After that, feel free to comment as you like.

### Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on the following:

- Content: There is no required word count, _per se_, but you must adequately address the questions posed and provide a meaningful, well-thought response. Did you answer the discussion question (and reply) with a thoughtful response that includes references to material presented in the lecture, readings, and/or web-readings?

- Grammar/style: Did you use proper grammar and style (spelling, complete sentences) making your post easy to understand?

- Participation: Did you submit the required number of posts (3). Initial thread and response posts must be made on *three separate days*. [Students must submit their initial threads by the end-of-day Thursday (at the latest) and your response posts should come over the rest of the week. You may submit more than the minimum required.]

- Follow the general guidelines of discussion etiquette (see Syllabus).

### Getting Started
To prepare for this discussion, you should go through the module pages, lecture slideshow, and web links provided.

Access the Discussion Forum, "Just Eat It!", and follow the instructions above. __For this activity, you must first submit your intial thread *before* you can view/respond to other posts.__
