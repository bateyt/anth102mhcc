## Instructions and Requirements

Imagine that that you are an archaeologist 1000 years in the future. You are part of a team excavating a small portion of a once prosperous city (or, perhaps, what is thought to have been a rural "hinterland"). The general area of the excavation is thought to be a habitation site.

While excavating, you and your team recover many different types of artifacts. For example, what artifacts may exist in the image below?

1. Choose an "artifact" that has been recovered from the site. To to this:
    + Check the glossary to review the terminology that archaeologists use:  What an <a href="https://diigo.com/08aol0" target="_blank"><b>artifact</b></a>?

> Artifacts are distinguished from the main body of the archaeological record such as stratigraphic features, which are non-portable remains of human activity, such as hearths, roads, deposits, trenches or similar remains, and from biofacts or ecofacts, which are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as seeds or animal bone. (Wikipedia)

How to choose an artifact? Look around your house; what types of "artifacts" do you see? For example, think of common things around a house or yard (e.g., cell phone, toaster oven, toilet, grill). As you are forming your artifact's display caption, think about what you have learned regarding how archaeologists classify artifacts.

2. In your description, think about the following:

    + How may the artifact be classified (material, style, function, form)?
    + What was the purpose of the artifact, did it hold any special ritual significance, or was it an instrument of everyday use?
    + What about the artifact, and its context, may have given data for your interpretation?
    
It may help to watch these two short videos illustrating artifact classification:

<br>
    
Consider our "artifact" (i.e., the laptop computer) from the image above. Have similar artifacts been recovered at other localities? How do styles of this type of artifact change over time? Recall what you have learned about <a href="http://proteus.brown.edu/fieldarchaeology2014/20064" target="_blank"><b>typologies</b></a>. What do these changes reflect, in terms of human behavior? In the image below, we can see that this artifact type has changed significantly over the last 25--30 years.
