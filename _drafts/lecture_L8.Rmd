### What to expect
Activities for this lesson include a discussion and quiz. In addition to going over the lecture slideshow, please look over the some of the other provided resources (below) on the archaeology of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Aegean.


### Walk Like an Egyptian
When I ask students what they think of when they think of archaeology (remember to our "Introductions" discussion), they often mention something related to ~~ancient~~ premodern Egypt (e.g., King Tut, pyramids, etc.). Egyptian archaeology is a classic case study in imperial archaeology. In the 19th and early-20th centuries, countless numbers of Egypt's cultural treasures were taken, without consent, and continue to be displayed in museums around the world. This brings us back to the question, "who owns the past?". I hope this is something you continue to think of as we make our way through the last few lessons.

In this lesson we will be looking at the earliest-known development of state-level organization, which are found in Mesopotamia and Egypt. On a side note (and less serious note), the Predynastic site of <a href="http://www.hierakonpolis-online.org/" target="_blank">Hierakonpolis</a>---mentioned in the text and, also, which is the archaeological site I studied for my dissertation---may be one of the <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/hierakonpolis/zombies.html" target="_blank">earliest-known instances of a zombie outbreak</a>. ;-)
