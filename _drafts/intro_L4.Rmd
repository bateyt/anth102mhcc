So, now you know what archaeology is, how to do it, and how archaeologists interpret their results in order to reconstruct the past. Now, it is time to consider the state of archaeology today. In this lesson, we will further explore the following:  the __goals of archaeology__ and the __theoretical approaches archaeologists use__ to get from observed data to interpretation; the types of __education and training__ necessary to be a professional archaeologist; the growing importance of __public/community archaeology__; and __ethical issues__ related to archaeology.

<!--Below, check out an aerial view of the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/exhibition/healing-ways/medicine-ways/medicine-wheel.html" target="_blank">Medicine Wheel</a>, an archaeological site with astronomical and biocultural significance, located within Bighorn National Forest in central Wyoming. Why did people construct this monument about 800 years ago? For what was it used? What significance did it have as a <a href="http://campusarch.msu.edu/?p=1292" target="_blank">sacred space</a>?-->

In this lesson, we will focus on the following:

- the methods that archaeologists use to analyze their data;
- the theoretical frameworks in which archaeologists interpret the results of those analyses in order to reconstruct the past;
- some basic models of cultural change;
- archaeology today, including the concepts of public/community archaeology, working with descendant communities; and
- the protection of cultural heritage (specifically archaeological resources) from looters and in areas of armed conflict.

### Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to successfully:

- Review methods and theory in archaeology (__cultural ecology__, ethnoarchaeology, experimental archaeology, general systems theory, __processual__ and __postprocessual__ archaeology).

- Understand common archaeological units (time/space), such as component, phase, tradition, etc.

- Understand common models for cultural change (for example, __innovation__ and __diffusion__) and processes by which cultures change.

- Categorize the practice of archaeology today (__public archaeology__, __cultural resources management (CRM)__.

- Describe some of the legal and ethical issues in archaeology (e.g., curation, conservation, looting, stewardship, colonial legacies).

- Understand the educational/experience requirements for professional archaeologists.
