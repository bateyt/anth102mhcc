Good comments, . The answer to the prompt question is pretty straightforward:  We did not evolve from monkeys. Based on the fossil record and molecular (DNA) studies of living primates (including humans), we currently understand that the evolutionary lineage of humans (i.e., the hominins) last shared a common ancestor with the evolutionary lineage of modern chimpanzees around 6-7 million years ago. That last common ancestor was an ape, not a monkey.

Of course, a common misunderstanding of the process of biological evolution (specifically speciation) underlies the "if there are still monkeys..." question posed in the prompt. New species can and have evolved from earlier forms that cease to exist, but evolution doesn't have to occur this way. Speciation also can occur while the "parent" species continues to exist. The earliest primate fossils that we consider apes evolved from monkey-type primates, but monkey populations continued to evolve. The monkey evolutionary lineage and the ape (including human) evolutionary lineage have been evolving separately for about the last 25-30 million years.
