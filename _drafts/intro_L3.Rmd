Now you have a grasp of the basic "how to" of archaeology, particularly with respect to *observing* and *collecting* archaeological data, we will start bridging the gap between data collection to interpretation by looking at how archaeologists *analyze* that data. 

Below, check out an aerial view of the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/exhibition/healing-ways/medicine-ways/medicine-wheel.html" target="_blank">Medicine Wheel</a>, an archaeological site with astronomical and biocultural significance, located within Bighorn National Forest in central Wyoming. Why did people construct this monument about 800 years ago? For what was it used? What significance did it have as a <a href="http://campusarch.msu.edu/?p=1292" target="_blank">sacred space</a>?

In this lesson, we will focus on the methods that archaeologists use to analyze their data and, eventually, interpret the results of those analyses in order to reconstruct the past. It may help to skim over previous readings, just to refresh yourself with some of the terminology that we have already covered.

### Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to successfully:

- Describe the process of artifact classification, particularly through __typologies__.
  + What are the most common materials of archaeological artifacts, and what do we know about their manufacture?
  
- Describe the concept of a __sacred space__, from the perspective of archaeology (and anthropology, generally) and connect to some archaeological examples using evidence from archaeo-astronomy.
 
- Describe the __main goals of archaeological research__ and some of the theoretical approaches that archaeologists use to reconstruct past human systems and recognize their own biases that may influence their interpretations.
 
- Describe the ways archaeologists attempt to reconstruct the "intangible" (e.g., inequality in the past, __gender__ in the archaeological record, __social ranking__ and __stratification__).
