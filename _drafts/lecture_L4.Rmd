### What to expect
Activities for this lesson include the following:

- Discussion forum

- Lesson quiz

- __*Midterm Exam*__

To prepare you for these activities, this lesson includes a slideshow and supplemental, online content.

Some of what you encounter in this lesson will be review. Before we launch into our survey of world prehistory in the next lesson, we are going to bring what we have learned so far together and firm up our grasp on archaeology today, as opposed to 150 (or even 50) years ago. The picture below shows some excavations from a community archaeology project at the cliffs at Low Hauxley, Northumberland (UK).
