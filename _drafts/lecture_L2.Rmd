### A note on linked web resources
Remember, take the time to check out the web links I provide. They can clarify highlights that you find in the lecture slideshow. Before getting started, check to see if you have fallen prey to any <a href="http://www.saa.org/AbouttheSociety/EducationandOutreach/CurriculumLinks/ArchaeologyintheClassroom/MythsandMisconceptions/tabid/209/Default.aspx" target="_blank">common misconceptions about archaeology</a>, some of which have already been considered.

If a hyperlink doesn't work with a simple click, right-click and select "Open in a new tab/window."
