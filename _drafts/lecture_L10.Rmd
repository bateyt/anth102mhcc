### What to expect
This week's lesson includes a quiz and discussion forum. In addition to going over the lecture slideshow, you may be interested (and, it would be helpful) in checking out the provided additional resources on archaeology in Mesoamerica and the Andean region of South America discussed in this lesson. 


### Prehistoric Greatness in the Americas
By now, you should have some appreciation of the development of social complexity, particularly regarding state-organized societies. You've seen some examples of how this process played out in parts of the Old World; now, we're going to consider these processes in the New World, specifically Mesoamerica and the Andean region of South America.
