In the previous lesson, you explored the early origins of agriculture and social complexity, but the discussion was limited to the region of the Near East (Levant)---specifically with the Natufian culture and later Neolithic cultures---and, to a lesser degree, southeastern Europe (i.e., LBK culture). In this lesson, we'll broaden our scope to consider domestication of plants and animals and developments in social complexity in other regions of the world, particularly in North and South America (including what is often termed “Mesoamerica”), Africa, China, and some parts of [Australasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia).
 
While some of the information covered in this lesson may be a review of concepts we've already discussed, we will be looking at some new information, too. In particular, we'll look at some of the "mound-building" cultures of ancient North America, like the Adena and Hopewell cultures. One thing that this lesson will do is further illustrate that archaeological evidence gathered since the mid-1900's does not support V. Gordon Childe's concept of the Neolithic "Revolution." This isn't to discredit Childe; he was working within the theoretical frameworks and data available at that time. As with other sciences, though, our models of the past must change, or at least be subjected to scrutiny, in light of new evidence.

### Objectives
