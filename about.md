## About the site
Welcome to the website for my ANTH 102 (Introduction to Archaeology and World Prehistory) class at Mt. Hood Community College. I created this website as a repository for teaching materials and resources for the class. In the future, I plan to use Jekyll's blog feature, in addition to hosting static pages.

## About me
My name is Trey Batey, and I'm a broadly-trained anthropologist with specialized training in skeletal biology, bioarchaeology, and forensic anthropology. My research interests include paleodemography, paleoepidemiology, the evolution of human life-history characteristics, and the dynamic relationship between human biocultural systems and the environment.
